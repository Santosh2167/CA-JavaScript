//Program three different ways to log each individual item in the array.
let myArray = [“one”, 2, true, 4];


//Write a function that adds all numbers together. If any argument is not a number return false


//Set 3 variables (you may call them whatever you want) to the first three elements of myArray using destructing


//Create a object from a class named Fruit. When an object is instantiated from the class set 3 properties on the object (name, color, bites). Also have a function in the class that when called takes a bite of the fruit and decrements the bites property. If there are no bites left in the fruit log to the console “All gone!”, if there was a bite log “So yummy”.
